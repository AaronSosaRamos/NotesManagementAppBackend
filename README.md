# NotesManagementAppBackend üìùüöÄ

Welcome to **NotesManagementAppBackend**, a comprehensive backend solution designed for managing notes, archived notes, and categories with a RESTful API approach. This project leverages **NestJS** for its modular structure, **JWT** and **BCrypt** for secure authentication, and **PostgreSQL** via **Knex.js** for database connectivity. The backend is deployed on **Vercel**, ensuring a smooth and scalable environment. Developed by **Wilfredo Aaron Sosa Ramos**, this backend solution aims to provide a robust foundation for any note management application.

## Introduction üß†

**NotesManagementAppBackend** is a feature-rich backend application designed with the **API REST** architecture in mind. Utilizing **NestJS**'s powerful dependency injection, this backend organizes functionality into multiple layers, such as Services, Repositories, Controllers, and Modules. It supports authentication via **JWT** and **BCrypt** to ensure that user data is secure.

The backend connects to a **PostgreSQL** database through **Knex.js**, providing flexible and efficient database interactions. The app is deployed on **Vercel**, where it seamlessly integrates with an instance of PostgreSQL hosted on Vercel.

## Key Features üåü

- **Notes Management**: Full CRUD operations for managing notes, including creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving notes.
- **Archived Notes**: Supports the management of archived notes, allowing users to keep track of notes that are no longer active.
- **Categories**: Supports the creation and management of categories for organizing notes.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implements **JWT** tokens for stateless authentication and **BCrypt** for secure password hashing.
- **Multiple Layers**: Organized with Service, Repository, Controller, and Module layers following NestJS best practices.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Uses **Knex.js** for database queries, offering seamless integration with PostgreSQL.
- **Swagger Documentation**: The API is fully documented using **Swagger** for easy reference and testing.
- **Environment Variables Management**: Powered by **t3-oss**, providing enhanced control over environment variables.

## Use Cases üõ†Ô∏è

**NotesManagementAppBackend** serves various use cases:

- **Personal Note-Taking**: Allows individuals to manage their notes, archive old notes, and categorize them for better organization.
- **Team Collaboration**: Can be extended to support team-based note-taking where multiple users can manage notes and assign categories.
- **Educational Tools**: Ideal for use in learning management systems to store lecture notes, assignments, and archived information.
- **Project Management**: Can be used to track project notes, milestones, and categorize tasks for better management.

## Tech Stack ‚öôÔ∏è

This backend application is built using the following technologies:

- **NestJS** üåê: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **JWT** üîí: JSON Web Tokens used for secure, stateless authentication.
- **BCrypt** üîë: A robust library for password hashing to enhance security.
- **Knex.js** üîó: A SQL query builder for PostgreSQL and other relational databases.
- **PostgreSQL** üêò: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **t3-oss** üß©: For advanced environment variable management.
- **Swagger** üìò: Auto-generates API documentation for seamless developer interaction.
- **Vercel** üåê: Deployment platform hosting both the backend API and PostgreSQL instance.

---

## Authentication and Security üîê

**NotesManagementAppBackend** employs industry-standard authentication and security mechanisms:

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Provides stateless authentication, allowing users to securely log in and manage their session tokens.
- **BCrypt**: Ensures that user passwords are hashed and stored securely in the database, reducing the risk of data breaches.
- **Middleware**: Custom middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints, improving the app's security.

---

## Database Integration üêò

The application is integrated with **PostgreSQL** using **Knex.js**:

- **Knex.js**: A SQL query builder that simplifies complex queries and migrations.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database is hosted on **Vercel**, and the app is designed to handle database connections efficiently, even in a deployed environment.

### Key Database Features:

- **Notes Table**: Stores all note-related information.
- **Archived Notes Table**: Keeps track of notes that are no longer active.
- **Categories Table**: Allows for categorizing notes for better organization.

---

## Environment Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

The project uses **t3-oss** to enhance the management of environment variables. This ensures that sensitive information such as database credentials, JWT secrets, and API keys are stored securely and accessed in a scalable manner.

### Environment Variables:

The following environment variables must be set in a `.env` file:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000

ALLOWED_UI_DOMAINS=http://localhost:3000

DB_HOST=your_db_host
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_DATABASE=your_db_name

EMAIL=your_email
PASSWORD=your_password

JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

These environment variables support:

- **NODE_ENV**: The environment in which the application is running (e.g., development, production).
- **PORT**: The port on which the backend will run.
- **ALLOWED_UI_DOMAINS**: Specifies which frontend domains are allowed to communicate with the backend.
- **DB_HOST, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_DATABASE**: PostgreSQL connection details.
- **EMAIL and PASSWORD**: Credentials for email services (if applicable).
- **JWT_SECRET**: The secret used to sign and verify JWT tokens.

---

## API Documentation üìò

The API is fully documented using **Swagger**, providing a clean interface to explore the available endpoints and test them interactively.

- **Access Swagger Docs**: Once the application is running, you can view the Swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

## How to Use ü§ñ

Once you've set up the project, you can start managing your notes, archived notes, and categories through the API. Here are some example endpoints:

### Notes

- **Create a Note**: `POST /notes`
- **Retrieve All Notes**: `GET /notes`
- **Update a Note**: `PUT /notes/:id`
- **Delete a Note**: `DELETE /notes/:id`

### Archived Notes

- **Retrieve All Archived Notes**: `GET /notes/archived`

### Categories

- **Create a Category**: `POST /categories`
- **Retrieve All Categories**: `GET /categories`

All endpoints are secured by **JWT**, so ensure you're authenticated before making requests.
